##Customer Churn Prediction and Sales Dashboard 

Project Overview 

The Customer Churn Prediction and Sales Dashboard project leverages Data Analytics 
and Machine Learning to analyze customer behavior, predict churn probability, and 
visualize sales trends. This system is essential for businesses, e-commerce platforms, and 
service providers to enhance customer retention and optimize sales strategies. 

Key Features 
1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing 
 Collect customer data from CRM systems, sales databases, and user interaction 
logs. 
 Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. 
 Handle missing values, normalize numerical data, and encode categorical variables. 
 Feature engineering to extract purchase frequency, engagement scores, and 
subscription tenure. 
customers=pd.read_csv("customer data")
transactions=pd.read_csv("transaction data")
product.csv(optional)

2. Churn Prediction Models 
 Supervised Learning Models: 
o Logistic Regression 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import LogisticRegression
X=
y=
o Decision Trees & Random Forest 
o Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) 
 Deep Learning Models: 
o Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) 
o Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-based churn trends 
 Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation: 
o K-Means Clustering 
o DBSCAN for anomaly detection 

3. Sales Trend Analysis 
 Track monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales growth. 
 Identify top-performing products/services. 
 Correlate churn trends with revenue impact. 
transaction['month']=transaction['date'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_sales=transaction.groupby('month')['amount').sum()

monthly_sales.plot(kind='line')
plt.title("Monthly sales trend")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.show()

4. Interactive Dashboard & Insights 
 Real-time customer retention and churn analysis.  
 Sales visualization using heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs. 
 Customer segmentation insights for targeted marketing. 

Technology Stack
